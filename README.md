Module CS385 Final project 
My contribute is 1 of 5 mini pixel games - "Snake" (SnakeView.java, snake.java)
Player can control the direction of a virtual snake (green bar on the screen) by just tapping the screen to move it and “eat” the “food” (a red square on the screen). When the head of snake touch the food square, it will be increased by the length of a food’s width. The food square will disappear when eaten by the snake and appear randomly around the screen immediately. 
It has 2 lose conditions: "eating"(touch) the snake's body or running into the “wall” (red boundary line). Both situations will fail the game and player can restart the game by tapping the screen again according to some hint texts. The aim of this game is to get the high scores and keep moving as long as possible.
This is a game that using a customized view as the play screen and depend on another java file to control the main thread of game running.
